Foreword
--------

This material is intended as a companion for the lectures in a course in Embedded Systems. The main objective is to present the inner works of the compilation process and introduce advanced patterns of software for embedded systems.

It assumes a basic knowledge of C. It consists of many small projects, each introducing one, and sometimes two, aspects of the development process.

Appendices show how to install the needed tools, how to use them and the structure of a project.

Peripherals
-----------

There are a lot of peripherals in the board.

-   LEDs using pins PE2 and PE3.
-   Buttons using pins PB9 and PB10
-   LCD Multiplexed 20Ã—8 with a 7 character alphanumeric field, a 4 digit numeric field and other symbols using pins PA0-PA11, PA15,PB0-PB6,PD9-PD12,PE4-PE7.
-   Touch Sensor using pins PC8-11.
-   Light Sensor using PD6,PC6
-   LC Sensor using PB12,PC7
-   NAND Flash using PB15, PE8-15, PC1-2, PF8-9, PD13-15
-   USB OTG using PF11-12, PF5-6

It is also possible to use the header connectors to add more peripherals.

Connections
-----------


The EMF32GG-STK3700 board has two USB connectors: One, a Mini USB B Connector, for development and other, a Micro B-Type USB Connector, for the application.

For development, a cable (delivered) must be connected between the Mini USB connector on the board and the A-Type connector on the PC. Among the devices listed by the *lsusb* command, the following must appear.

    Bus 001 Device 019: ID 1366:0101 SEGGER J-Link PLUS

The STK3700 board has two microcontrollers: one, called target, is a EFM32GG990F1024 microcontroller, and the other, called Board Controller, implements an interface for programming and debugging.

For a Cortex M microcontroller the following programming interfaces are used:

-   SWD : 2 pinos: SWCLK, SWDIO - Serial Wire Debug.
-   JTAG : 4 pinos: TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO - Not used in this board

In the STK3700 only the SWD interface is used, and there is a connector on the SWD lines which permits the debugging of off-board microcontrollers.

Generally, in this kind of boards there is a serial interface between the Target and the Board Controller. It can be implemented using a physical channel with 2 lines or a virtual, using the SWD/JTAG channel. Both appears to the Host PC as a serial virtual port (*COMx* or */dev/ttyACMx*). In the STK3700 board the serial channel uses the UART0 unit (pins PE0 and PE1).

Examples for the EFM32GG-STK3700 Development Board
--------------------------------------------------

In all examples, a direct access to registers approach was used. It means that no library besides CMSIS was used.

*    01-Blink-NO: How to not do it
-    02-Blink: Blick LEDs with a HAL for GPIO
-    03-Blink: Blink LEDs with a LED HAL above the GPIO HAL

OBS:

-    The hardware decoding in 25-Quadrature-v2 is not working well. Probably
     the encoder is too noisy. I will try with a better one.
