Foreword
--------

This material is intended as a companion for the lectures in a course in Embedded Systems. The main objective is to present the inner works of the compilation process and introduce advanced patterns of software for embedded systems.

It assumes a basic knowledge of C. It consists of many small projects, each introducing one, and sometimes two, aspects of the development process.

A [companion text](Developing-for-the-EFM32GG-STK3700-using-gcc-and-makefiles.pdf) describes the projects and the source code.
[Another text](Installing-Tools.md) shows how to install the needed tools, how to use them and the structure of a project.

Connections
-----------


The EMF32GG-STK3700 board has two USB connectors: One, a Mini USB B Connector, for development and other, a Micro B-Type USB Connector, for the application.

For development, a cable (delivered) must be connected between the Mini USB connector on the board and the A-Type connector on the PC. Among the devices listed by the *lsusb* command, the following must appear.

    Bus 001 Device 019: ID 1366:0101 SEGGER J-Link PLUS

The STK3700 board has two microcontrollers: one, called target, is a EFM32GG990F1024 microcontroller, and the other, called Board Controller, implements an interface for programming and debugging.

For a Cortex M microcontroller the following programming interfaces are used:

-   SWD : 2 pinos: SWCLK, SWDIO - Serial Wire Debug.
-   JTAG : 4 pinos: TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO - Not used in this board

In the STK3700 only the SWD interface is used, and there is a connector on the SWD lines which permits the debugging of off-board microcontrollers.

Generally, in this kind of boards there is a serial interface between the Target and the Board Controller. It can be implemented using a physical channel with 2 lines or a virtual, using the SWD/JTAG channel. Both appears to the Host PC as a serial virtual port (*COMx* or */dev/ttyACMx*). In the STK3700 board the serial channel uses the UART0 unit (pins PE0 and PE1).

OBS:

1.   The hardware decoding in 29-Hardware-based-Quadrature-Decoding is
     not working well. Probably the encoder is too noisy. I will try with
     a better one.
2.    **Projects marked with an asterisk are unfinished!!!**
3.    **Projects marked with a double asterisk are in a very initial stage**
