# 4 Connections

The EMF32GG-STK3700 board has two USB connectors:

* Debug USB (Mini USB B Connector), connected to the Board Controller, for development and debugging
* Target USB (Micro AB-Type USB Connector), connected to the target EFM32F990F1024 microcontroller

         --------            -----------          -------         -------------
         \      /            \   ----  /         /  ----  \       |           |
         | ---- |             ---------          \        /       |----       |
         --------                                 --------        -------------
           Mini B                 Micro B           Micro AB             A

For development, a cable (delivered) must be connected between the Mini
USB connector on the board and the A-Type connector on the PC. Among
the devices listed by the *lsusb* command, the following must appear.

    Bus 001 Device 019: ID 1366:0101 SEGGER J-Link PLUS

The STK3700 board has two microcontrollers: one, called target, is a
EFM32GG990F1024 microcontroller, and the other, called Board Controller
implements an interface for programming and debugging.

For a ARN Cortex M microcontroller the following programming interfaces can be used:

| Interface    | # pins | Signals                    | Name                    | OBS      |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| SWD          |    2   |  SWCLK, SWDIO              | Serial Wire Debug.      |          |
| JTAG         |    4   | TCK TMS TDI TDO            | Joint Test Action Group | Not used |

There is a connector on the board that permits the debugging using external SWD adapters.

There is a serial interface between the Target and the Board
Controller. It is implemented  using a physical channel with 2 lines. It appears to the Host PC as
a serial virtual port (COMx in Windows or  /dev/ttyACMx in Linux). In the STK3700 board the serial
channel uses the UART0 unit (PE0 and PE1).

# 5 Power

The board can be powered thru the:

* Debug USB (DBG)
* Target USB (USB)
* On board battery (BAT)

There is a 3-position switch with positions BAT, USB and DBG. When the board is powered thru the
USB debug port, the switch must be in the DGB position.

# 6 Tools

The essential tools needed for compiling the projects are:

1. Toolchain (Compiler/Linker/Debugger/Tools) supporting the
microcontroller family
2. Files specific to the microcontroller  from
ARM and manufacturer (header files, libraries and start files)
3. Flash tools;
4. Make;

Highly recommended are the following tools:

1. Git: Version Control
2. Doxygen: Documentation tool from source code
3. An text editor like gedit (Linux), Notepad++(Windows).


To debug an application, a debugger is needed and it is part of the
GNU C toolchain. It has a very crude CLI (Command Line Interface (CLI).
So, an interface with a graphic User Interface (GUI) for the debugger
is more comfortable.

Optionally, one can use an Integrated Developing Environments (IDE)
instead of an text editor.

# 7 GNU Arm Toolchain

## 7.1 Introduction

The GNU toolchain is a package of applications that runs on a host and
generates application for target microcontroller (cross-compiling). It
consists of:

* compiler including preprocessor
* linker
* archiver
* utils like nm, ranlib, etc.

In [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)
there are many versions of the GNU toolchain. To develop for
microcontrollers without operating systems (bare-metal), the version with the none-eabi
suffix is to be used.

## 7.2 Toolchain versions

The are versions of the toolchain for Windows, Linux and Mac(darwin)
operation systems. The Linux and Darwin version can be based on a system
with a Intel or an ARM processor. For Windows hosted systems there are
self-installing executable and a zip file.

There are for 32-bit (AArch32) and 64-bit (AArch64) )microprocessors.
There are version for EABI and EABIHF programming interfaces (See below).

There are text files containing the checksum for MD5 (.asc suffix) and SHA26 (.sha356asc suffix).
So it is possible to verify the integrity of the downloaded file.

The name convention for the files is show below.

    arm-gnu-toolchain-<Release Version>-<Host>-<Target Triple>.tar.xz

The only target of interest is none, i.e., bare metal system or in other
words, without an operating system. Which version to use depends on the
operating system of the host computer and on the microcontroller to be used.

The table below shows a listing of the applications in the toolchain. To
avoid conflict with the applications targeted to the host system, all
applications in the GNU Arm Toolchain have a prefix. In case of bare
metal systems, the prefix is *arm-none-eabi-*

| Application     |  Description                                         |

## 7. Application Binary Interface (ABI)

There are many ABIs sponsored by ARM:

* ABI (Application Binary Interface). Obsolete. Also called OABI (Old ABI)
* EABI (Embedded Application Binary Interface):
* EABIHF (Application Binary Interface for devices with hardware floating point)

In the EABI, the parameters in and out of a function are in the integer registers.
When a processor has a hardware floating point unit, optionally the parameter can be passed using
the floating point registers.



# 8 Installing procedure for Linux machines

## 8.1 Introduction

In Linux system, the installation process is straightforward. Some
software like Make, Git and Doxygen can be installed using the Software
Manager used. For example, in Debian machine, just enter the commands

    sudo apt install make git doxygen

It is also possible to use a graphical interface like Synaptic to
install packages.

The newer versions of the toolchain uses the XZ compactor. To unpack it,
it is needed to install the xz-utils package.

    sudo apt install xz-utils

TODO : liblzma Unpacker tool XZ files for Linux.  Python v3.8 is needed
by GDB M


## 8.2 Installing the compiler toolchain

A toolchain for ARM is the ARM GNU CC, which includes compiler, assembler,
 linker,  debugger, and many utilities. It can be downloaded from [ARM
 GNU GCC](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) or
 installing using a package manager like apt. The toolchain is a version
 of the GNU C ported to ARM processors in a project backed by ARM itself.

Under the Section x86_64 Linux hosted cross toolchains: AArch32 bare-metal
target (arm-none-eabi), one can find the following files:


>> To verify the integrity of the downloaded files one can use the md5sum
application and compare the result with the one in the .asc file. The
.sha256asc contains the checksum generated by sha256sum.

The package file, named gcc-arm-none-eabi-XXXXX-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
(XXXXX is the version information) must be downloaded into a directory,
for example, $HOME/Downloads. Linux distributions have an special
directory for the installation of packages outside the package manager
used by the distribution. Generally it is the /opt directory.

    # Unpack int cd /opt/ tar -xvf
    $HOME/Downloads/gcc-arm-none-eabi-XXXXX-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
    # Change name to a name without version information mv
    gcc-arm-none-eabi-XXXXX-x86_64 /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi

The name was change to a name without version information, in order to
avoid extra work, when upgrading the toolchain.

The next step is to add it to the PATH variable, to it can be run without
the need of a full path. This is done by editing the $HOME/.bashrc file
and adding the following lines to the end.


    # # Embedded ARM GCC # ARMGCC_HOME=/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi
    PATH=$ARMGCC_HOME/bin:$PATH

After installing the toolchain, the following applications are available
as commands:

    arm-none-eabi-addr2line   arm-none-eabi-gcc-nm         arm-none-eabi-lto-dump
    arm-none-eabi-ar          arm-none-eabi-gcc-ranlib     arm-none-eabi-nm
    arm-none-eabi-as          arm-none-eabi-gcov           arm-none-eabi-objcopy
    arm-none-eabi-c++         arm-none-eabi-gcov-dump      arm-none-eabi-objdump
    arm-none-eabi-c++filt     arm-none-eabi-gcov-tool      arm-none-eabi-ranlib
    arm-none-eabi-cpp         arm-none-eabi-gdb            arm-none-eabi-readelf
    arm-none-eabi-elfedit     arm-none-eabi-gdb-add-index  arm-none-eabi-size
    arm-none-eabi-g++         arm-none-eabi-gfortran       arm-none-eabi-strings
    arm-none-eabi-gcc         arm-none-eabi-gprof          arm-none-eabi-strip
    arm-none-eabi-gcc-13.2.1  arm-none-eabi-ld
    arm-none-eabi-gcc-ar      arm-none-eabi-ld.bfd


To verify the installation, enter the name *arm-none-eabi-gcc* in a
command prompt. If the output contains "no input files", the installation
is correct. If not, the procedure above must be repeated adding the
correct folder to PATH.


## 8.3 Files specific to the EFM32

The files needed for development for a specific microcontroller are:

    • headers: that define the registers to access the hardware.
    • library files: libraries needed by gcc (can be superseded by
    the ones in the toolchain) • start files: contains initialization
    routines and interrupt vectors.  • linker script: instructs the
    gcc how to correctly build the program

They are contained (and a lot more) in a Software Development Kit
(SDK), called *Gecko_SDK*, provided the Silicon Labs. For a while,
the Gecko_SDK was no more supported as a standalone product.  It was
(and is) contained if the
 [Simplicity  Studio](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio),
 a free IDE provided by Silicon Labs. Simplicity Studio is based on
 [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), and one of its features is that it
 downloads the support files as they are needed for a project reducing
 the demands on the capacity of the hard drives.

>> *Gecko_SDJ is HUGE, about 300 MBytes zipped and 2,4 GBytes after unzipping.

Gecko_SDK  is now available again at
[github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK).
An older version can still be found at [Silicon Labs Support
Documents](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Gecko_SDK.zip).
But to reduce the demand on disk area, one can use a
minimal *Gecko_SDK* that contains only the files needed
to compile the projects. Just clone [Mininal Gecko_SDK
repository](https://github.com/hans-jorg/Gecko_SDK_minimal).


To get the most recent GeckoSDK, one can clone the github repo
[Geck SDK](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK).

    cd GECKOSDKDIR
    git clone https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK

To install from compacted files, follow the steps below, replacing DOWNLOAD and GECKOSDKDIR
with the full path of the  Download and Gecko_SDK folder:

1. Download the package (Gecko_SDK.zip or Gecko_SDK_minimal.zip) using
a browser into a DOWNLOAD folder.  2. Using command line, change to the
folder where it will be installed.

    cd GECKOSDKDIR

3. Unzip

    unzip DOWNLOADS/Gecko_SDK.zip
or
    unzip DOWNLOADS/Gecko_SDK_minimal.zip


In the GECKOSDK/platform/Device/SiliconLabs/EFM32GG/Include/ folder one
can find the headers with the register and field definition. For example,
for the EFM32GG990F104 microcontroller, there is efm32gg990f1024.h
file. The symbols are defined according the CMSIS Standard. There are
also header files for peripherals like efm32gg_gpio.h, efm32gg_adc.h and
others, which are already included by the device specific header file,
so there is no need to explicitly include them.

Although it is possible and quite common to include the device specific
file directly, a better approach is to use a "generic" header, and define
which device using a pre-preprocessor symbol during compilation. Copy
then the file em_device.h from the same folder to the project folder and
define the symbol EFM32GG990f1024 with the -DEFM32GG990f1024 compiler
parameter. During compilation the correct file will be included. This
is the approach followed in the projects.

There is other header file, called em_chip.h locate in the
Gecko_SDK/platform/emlib/inc folder that defines the CHIP_Init
function. This function must be called at the very beginning and it
corrects some bugs in core implementation. Since it calls other header
files from the same folder, a better idea is to add this folder to the
include path with the -IGecko_SDK/platform/emlib/inc/ parameter.

The package Gecko_SDK contains the start files and linker scripts. But
since they must be adapted to a project, they are already part of the
project files.

## 8.4 Tool to flash the device

To transfer the binary memory image to the flash memory of the
microcontroller, one can use the Segger J-Link software. It is also
possible to use OpenOCD, but it is not (yet) tested.

First, the JLink Debian package must be downloaded from
[Segger](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/). Choose *64-bit DEB
Installer*. Optionally, it is possible to install the Ozone package,
an GUI interface for JLink. Look down below in the page. Again, download
the 64-bit DEB Installer.

To install them on Linux, run the following commands, but take note that
the version information changes often.

    sudo dpkg -i JLink_Linux_V622b_x86_64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i ozone_2.54_x86_64.deb

After installing JLink, the following application are available in the
/opt/SEGGER/JLink folder, with the corresponding links in /usr/bin folder.

    JFlashSPI_CL        JLinkExe            JLinkGDBServer
    JLinkLicenseManager JLinkRegistration   JLinkRemoteServer
    JLinkRTTClient      JLinkRTTLogger JLinkSTM32          JLinkSWOViewer
    JTAGLoadExe         Ozone

If the links in the /usr/bin folder are not created, adjust the PATH to
include the folder /opt/SEGGER/JLink as done for the toolchain.


## 8.5 Debugging Tools

The J-Link package installed as above contains the programs needed to
create a debug session.


# 9 Installing procedure for Windows machines


## 9.1 General instructions

In Windows, there is always the possibility to

* Install all packages directy in Windows * Use a virtual machine with a
Linux distribution and install the linux packages * Install the Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL/WSL2)

The approach shown here, is to install Windows versions of the different
tools.

Recent version of the GNU Arm Toolchain demands the installation
of the [mingW-64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) package.  Them *mingw-64*
is a successor of an old package called [mingw](https://mingw.osdn.io),
that adds to windows machines
  support for GNU tools. It includes

## 9.2 Install MingW-64

To install mingw-64, access [MinGW-64 Downloads](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) and
click on the WinLibs link. It redirects to the
[standalone build of GCC and MinGW-w64 for Windows ](https://winlibs.com/) site.

There are versions for different runtimes (MSVCRT and UCRT) and different threading
libraries (POSIX, WIN32, MCF). Good choices are UCRT and POSIX.

Unpack the downloaded file into a folder MINGWDIR (or whatever name was choosen).

Added the MINGWDIR/bin folder to the PATH. See below.


## 9.3 Adding a folder to the PATH

An important step in the installation of a software in Windows, that must
be accessed thru a command line, is to add it to the PATH environment
variable. This variable is a list of folders searched by Windows when
trying to locate a command.

1.	In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
2.  Click the Advanced system settings link.
3.  Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables find the PATH environment
variable and select it. Click Edit. If the PATH environment variable does
not exist, click New.
4.  In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, clock the New button (or if it
is wrong defined, Edit button).
5.  Enter the full path of the folder where the software was
installed and click the OK button.
6.	Close all windows opened for the editing and all command prompt windows.
7.  Open a command prompt window and enter the program name and press Enter. This command prompt
window must be open AFTER the change of the PATH variable, so it can get the new value.
9.	A message like “program is not recognized as
an internal or external program.” shows that the PATH is not correctly
defined and the procedure must be repeated with the correct path.


## 9.4 Installing make

There are three source of make for Windows machines.

* [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* [Chocolatey: The Package Manager for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/)
* [Builtin Make in Mingw]()

Using the *Make for Windows* approach, the steps are:

1. Download the *Complete package, except sources*
[Setup](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/make.php) 2. Locate
it and double click it, to start execution of the installer.

Using the *Chocolatey* approach

1. Install *Chocolatey* following these
[instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install)
2. Enter the command
below in a Power Shell prompt as an administrator.

    choco install make

In both case, to verify the installation, enter the command

    make --version

If the output contains something like *make is not recognized as an
internal or external program*, the installation is wrong and must be
repeated. It is also possible that it is not in PATH.


## 9.5 Installing the toolchain

It is possible to install the toolchain from a compressed file or using
an installer.

The corresponding files can be found in Section *Windows (mingw-w64-i686) hosted cross toolchains*
*AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)*


    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.zip
    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.zip.asc
    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.zip.sha256asc
    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe
    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe.asc
    arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION-SUBVERSION-RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe.sha256asc

For now

    VERSION = 13
    SUBVERSION = 2
    RELEASE = rel1

The file of intereset is
*arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION.SUBVERSION.RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.zip* altough its
executable version with the .exe suffix can be used.


To use the executable option, download the file
*arm-gnu-toolchain-VERSION.SUBVERSION.RELEASE-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.zip*
or a newer version form [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
Downloads](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
Using the File Manager, locate it in the Downloads folder and double
click on it. Enter the installation folder when asked.

Using the compressed filed approach, the file
*gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.zip* (or a
newer version) must be downloaded from [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
Downloads](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
Using the File Manager, locate it in the Downloads folder and double
click on it. Enter the installation folder when asked.

A good idea is to install in a folder without version information. Doing
so, upgrading the toolchain will not demand extra steps to change the
configuration.

The next step is to add the folder to the PATH as described in section
9.2.

## 9.6 Files specific to the EFM32

The files needed for development for a specific microcontroller are:

    • headers: that define the registers to access the hardware.
    • library files: libraries needed by gcc (can be superseded by the ones in the toolchain)
    • start files: contains initialization routines and interrupt vectors.
    • linker script: instructs the C compiler on how to correctly build the program.

They are contained (and a lot more) in a Software Development Kit (SDK),
called Gecko_SDK, provided
 the Silicon Labs. It is now part of the [Simplicity
 Studio](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio),
 an free IDE provided by Silicon Labs. Simplicity Studio is based on
 [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), and one of its features is that it
 downloads the support files as they are needed for a project.

But recently, Gecko_SDK  is available at
[github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk) again and it is
still maintained.

> Recent modifications of GeckSDK have broken the Makefiles. The Cortex-M
files are now found in > the GECKOSDKDIR/platform/CMSIS/Core/Include and
not in GECKOSDKDIR/platform/CMSIS/Include anymore.  > The Makefiles must
be modified accordling by setting

Alternatively an old version can still be found at [Silicon Labs Support
Documents](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Gecko_SDK.zip).

>> Gecko_SDK is HUGE, about 300 MBytes zipped and 2,4 GBytes after unzipping.

To spare disk space, one can clone a [Mininal Gecko_SDK
repository](https://github.com/hans-jorg/Gecko_SDK_minimal), that consists
of a stripped down version of Gecko_SDK, that contains only the files
needed to compile the projects.

To install them, follow the steps below, replacing DOWNLOAD and GECKOSDK
with the full path of the Download and Gecko_SDK folder:

1. Download the package (Gecko_SDK.zip or Gecko_SDK_minimal.zip) using
a browser into a DOWNLOAD folder.  2. Using command line, change to the
folder where it will be installed.

    cd Gecko_SDK

3. Unzip using command line

    unzip DOWNLOADS/Gecko_SDK.zip
or
    unzip DOWNLOADS/Gecko_SDK_minimal.zip
or the builtin unzip tool in Windows by double clicking on the downloaded
file. Choose the folder where the Gecko_SDK is to be unpacked, name hereafter GECKOSDKDIR.

In the GECKOSDKDIR/platform/Device/SiliconLabs/EFM32GG/Include/ folder one
can find the headers with the register and field definition. For example,
for the EFM32GG990F104 microcontroller, there is efm32gg990f1024.h
file. The symbols are defined according the CMSIS Standard. There are
also header files for peripherals like efm32gg_gpio.h, efm32gg_adc.h and
others, which are already included by the device specific header file,
so there is no need to explicitly include them.

Although it is possible and quite common to include the device specific
file directly, a better approach is to use a "generic" header, and define
which device using a pre-preprocessor symbol during compilation. Copy
then the file em_device.h from the same folder to the project folder and
define the symbol EFM32GG990f1024 with the -DEFM32GG990f1024 compiler
parameter. During compilation the correct file will be included. This
is the approach followed in the projects.

There is other header file, called em_chip.h locate in the
Gecko_SDK/platform/emlib/inc folder that defines the CHIP_Init
function. This function must be called at the very beginning and it
corrects some bugs in core implementation. Since it calls other header
files from the same folder, a better idea is to add this folder to the
include path with the -IGecko_SDK/platform/emlib/inc/ parameter.

The package Gecko_SDK contains the start files and linker scripts. But
since they must be adapted to a project, they are part of the project
files.

## 9.7 Tool to flash the device

To transfer the binary memory image to the flash memory of the
microcontroller, one can use the Segger J-Link software.

First, the JLink Windows installer must be downloaded from
[Segger](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/). Choose Windows 64-bit
Installer. Optionally, it is possible to install the Ozone package
(again choose the Windows 64-bit Installer), an GUI interface for
JLink. It can be found below in the same page.

To install them on Windows, double click on the downloaded files.

After installing JLink, the following application are available in the
C:/SEGGER/JLink folder.

    JFlashSPI_CL	JLinkExe	    JLinkGDBServer
    JLinkLicenseManager JLinkRegistration   JLinkRemoteServer
    JLinkRTTClient	JLinkRTTLogger JLinkSTM32	   JLinkSWOViewer
    JTAGLoadExe		Ozone

Adjust the PATH to include this folder as described in Section 9.2.


## 9.8 Debugging Tools

The J-Link package installed as above contains the programs needed to
create a debug session.


## 9.9 Installing git

There is a [Windows version](https://gitforwindows.org/). When
one clicks on Download, it will be redirected to a [github
repository](https://github.com/git-for-windows/). In the releases folder,
one can find *Git-2.34.1-64.exe* (or a newer version) that is an installer
for a 64-bit Windows machine. Download it and double click on it.


## 9.10 Installing Doxygen

In the [Doxygen site](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) one can find
a installer for Windows called *doxygen-1.9.2-setup.exe*. Download it
and double click on it to start the installer.


# 10 Using the tools

A command line makes all easier.

    JLinkExe -if swd -device EFM32GG990F1024 -speed 2000

Considering that the debugging session will be done with GDB, the only
important commands for JLink are related to flashing a program:

* *exit*: quits JLink
* *g*: start the CPU core
* *h*: halts the CPU core
* *r*: resets and halts the target
* *erase*: erase internal flash
* *loadfile*: load data file into target memory


## 10.2 Flashing

To use the JLinkExe to write the flash contents one has to use the
following command:

    $JLinkExe -Device EFM32GG990F1024 -If SWD -Speed 4000 -CommanderScript Flash.jlink

The Flash.jlink file has the following contents:

    r h loadbin <path>,<base address> r

## 10.3 Debugging

To use GDB as a debugging tool, the GDB Proxy must be started first
using the command

     JLinkGDBServer -if SWD -device EFM32GG995F1024 -speed 4000


In other window to start the gdb the following command is used:

    $arm-none-eabi-gdb <execfile>
    (gdb) monitor reset
    (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
    (gdb) break main
    (gdb) monitor go


To debug using GDB see [Debugging with
GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/).  The most used
commands are:

* *cont*: continues the execution
* *break*: sets a breakpoint in a function or in a line
* *list*: lists source file
* *next*: steps skipping over functions
* *step*: steps entering functions
* *display*: Displays the contents of a variable at each prompt.
* *print*: Prints the contents of a variable

The monitor commands enable direct access to JLink functionalities,
as shown below.

* *monitor reset*: resets the CPU
* *monitor halt*: halts he CPU

The commands can be abbreviated by typing just enough characters. For
example, *b main* is the same of *break main*.

# 11 Sample project

## 11.1 Structure

A sample project for a EFM32GG microcontroller consists of:

* application source files (e,g, main.c)
* startup file (startup_efm32gg.c), copied from
* CMSIS system initialization file (system_efm32gg.c) copied from
* linker script (efm32gg.ld) copied from ......
* header file (em_device.h) copied from
* Makefile, a build automation tool
* Optionally, README.md, a description of project
* Optionally, Doxyfile, configuration file for doxygen, a documentation generator

## 11.2 Makefile

The make application can automate a lot of task in the software
development. The recipes are specified in a Makefile. The Makefile
provides a lot of options, which can be specified in the command line. In
the Makefile, it is possible (and sometimes nedded) to adjust compilation
parameters and specify where the required folders and applications
are. For example, OBJDIR is specified as gcc and is the folder where
all object files and the executable are generated. PROGNAME is the
project name

* *make all*        generate image file in OBJDIR
* *make flash*      write to flash memory in microcontroller
* *make clean*      delete all generated files
* *make dis*        disassemble output file into OBJDIR)/PROGNAME.S
* *make dump*       generate a hexadecimal dump file into OBJDIR/PROGNAME.dump
* *make nm*         list symbol table in standard output
* *make size*	    list size of output file
* *make term*	    open a terminal for serial communication to board
* *make debug*	    start an GDB proxy and the GDB debugger
* *make gdbproxy*   start the GDB proxy
* *make docs*	    generates docs using doxygen


# 12 Create a Debug Session

In the GCC toolchain, the tool for debugging is the GNU Project Debugger
(GDB), in the form specific for ARM (arm-none-eabi-gdb). It run on the
PC and since it can not communicate directly with the microcontroller,
a relay mechanism is needed in the form of a GDB proxy. The GDB proxy
can be the Segger JLinkGDBServer or the openocd.

This is a two step process:

1. In a separated window, start the GDB Proxy

    $JLinkGDBServer \<parameters\>

2. In other window, start GDB and stabilishes a connection

    arm-none-eabi-gdb \<executable file\> (gdb) target remote
    localhost:2331

The ARM GNU GDB has a Command Line Interface (CLI) as default and a Text
User Interface (TUI), which can be activated with a -ui parameter. There
are many Graphic User Interface (GUI) applications for GDB including
ddd and nemiver.

# Annex A - Determining stack usage

First, use the -fstack-usage option for compiling. It makes the compiler
generate a .su file for each .c file. Each line of it, contains the
function name and the size of stack.

    led.c:21:6:LED_Init         16  static
    led.c:42:6:LED_On           16  static
    led.c:51:6:LED_Off          16  static
    led.c:60:6:LED_Toggle       16  static
    led.c:69:6:LED_Write        16  static

This is not enough, because on must know who call who (callgraph) to
determine the stack usage.

To get the call graph, there are many options to generate the needed
information:

* Use -fdump-rtl-dfinish option * Use -fdump-ipa-cgraph * Use cflow to
generate the call graph

And the use a tool, to combine the information of callgraph and stack
usage.

An important note is that functions called thru function pointers or
interrupts are not considered.

A list of these tools:

* [Worst case stack](https://github.com/PeterMcKinnis/WorstCaseStack)
* [Stack Usage](https://github.com/sharkfox/stack-usage)
* [Avstack](https://dlbeer.co.nz/oss/avstack.html)
* [Cflow.py](https://blog.soutade.fr/post/2019/04/max-stack-usage-for-c-program.html)

## Worst case stack

Needs the fdump-rtl-dfinish option during compilation.

It needs all input files (with suffixes .o, .su, and .c) in the same
directory.  So copy all .c files to gcc folder and then run

    python3 wcs.py

Additional information can be added thru .msu files.

## Stack Usage

Needs the -fdump-ipa-cgraph option during compilation.


First all files (.su and .cgraph) must be combined.

    find . -name "*.cgraph" | grep -v stack-usage-log | xargs cat > stack-usage-log.cgraph
    find . -name "*.su" | grep -v stack-usage-log | xargs cat > stack-usage-log.su

And then generates the report using

    python3 stack-usage.py --csv stack-usage.csv --json stack-usage.json

## Avstack

It uses a Perl script to read .su files and disassemble the object
.o files.


## cflow

It is possible to generate the callgraph using cflow

    (cflow -l  -b --omit-arguments -D$(PART) $(addprefix -I
    ,${INCLUDEPATH}) $(SRCFILES) 2>&1) | egrep -v "^cflow"

And the use the cflow.py to generate the report.
